## Description

This application allows user to compare prices and choose computer components that is compatible for building PC workstation.

## Notes
For each computer components data, they are not synced with its current pricing and new ones coming as of today, thus, each computer components brand are at MSRP price by default. The data are saved in local and it is updated as of January 1, 2020

## Future Updates
Hopefully, this app will get UI design improvements as well as fetching accurate data for each component in order to give app-user a best experience.
